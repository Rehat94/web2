                    <p>Creating the Python Calculator project was a key milestone in my coding journey, allowing me to apply concepts from the #100DaysOfCode challenge while enhancing my skills in Python, Tkinter ,and object-oriented programming. I designed a user-friendly interface with real-time result displays and robust error handling, honing my problem-solving abilities and understanding of GUI development.By following a modular approach, I created an organized, maintainable codebase while learning to balance functionality and aesthetics through thoughtful design.</p>

                    <p>The custom String class in C++ is designed to mimic std::string while providing complete control over dynamic memory management. By manually handling memory allocation, copying, and deallocation, this class demonstrates essential object-oriented programming concepts like encapsulation, operator overloading, deep copying, and move semantics.This class can serve as a foundation for custom libraries, a practice tool for memory management and operator overloading, and an efficient solution for handling large text data.Performance is reducing unnecessary memory operations. </p>

                    <p>Developing the Python Snake Game enhanced my problem-solving, design, and programming skills. Implementing smooth controls and dynamic food mechanics taught me to break complex tasks into manageable solutions. High-score tracking deepened my understanding of file handling and data persistence, while debugging collision detection sharpened my attention to detail. This project reinforced modular programming, logical thinking, and creativity. It also inspired me to explore advanced concepts like multiplayer features and game challenges, further fueling my passion for programming.</p>

                    <p>Developing the Countdown Timer app strengthened my skills in GUI design, logic implementation, and user-centric programming. Using Tkinter, I created an interactive interface with buttons, input fields, and a dynamic canvas, emphasizing modular and reusable code. Designing a visually appealing UI taught me the importance of consistency in color, fonts, and layout. Implementing the countdown logic improved my understanding of recursive functions and Tkinterâ€™s scheduling methods. This project enhanced my ability to merge functionality with aesthetics, boosting my confidence.</p>

                    <p>Created an Amazon clone using CSS was an incredible learning experience. It strengthened my skills in responsive design, layout structuring, and CSS styling techniques. Revisiting lessons helped reinforce key concepts, while applying them in a practical project taught me problem-solving and debugging. This project improved my ability to replicate professional designs, manage attention to detail, and prioritize user experience. Thanks to Apna College's resources, I gained confidence in building visually appealing and functional web pages, fueling my passion tackle more advanced challenges.</p>
